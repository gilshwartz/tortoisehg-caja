	:synopsis: Describe using TortoiseHg as a front-end to other VCS

This chapter describes the three most popular Mercurial extensions for
interoperating with *foreign* VCS systems.  See also `Repository
Conversion <http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/RepositoryConversion>`_

.. _perfarce-perforce:

Perfarce (Perforce)
===================

* `Perfarce <http://www.kingswood-consulting.co.uk/hg/perfarce/>`_ home page.
* `Mercurial for Perforce users <http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/PerforceConcepts>`_

This extension modifies the remote repository handling so that repository
paths that resemble::

	p4://p4server[:port]/clientname

cause operations on the named p4 client specification on the p4 server.
The client specification must already exist on the server before using
this extension. Making changes to the client specification Views causes
problems when synchronizing the repositories, and should be avoided.

Five built-in Mercurial commands are overridden.

outgoing::

	If the destination repository name starts with p4:// then this
	reports files affected by the revision(s) that are in the local
	repository but not in the p4 depot.

push::

	If the destination repository name starts with p4:// then this
	exports changes from the local repository to the p4 depot. If no
	revision is specified then all changes since the last p4 changelist
	are pushed. In either case, all revisions to be pushed are foled
	into a single p4 changelist.  Optionally the resulting changelist is
	submitted to the p4 server, controlled by the --submit option to
	push, or by setting **perfarce.submit** to True.  If the option
	**perfarce.keep** is False then after a successful submit the files
	in the p4 workarea will be deleted.

pull::

	If the source repository name starts with p4:// then this imports
	changes from the p4 depot, automatically creating merges of
	changelists submitted by hg push.  If the config option
	**perfarce.keep** is False then the import does not leave files in
	the p4 workarea, otherwise the p4 workarea will be updated with the
	new files.

incoming::

	If the source repository name starts with p4:// then this
	reports changes in the p4 depot that are not yet in the local
	repository.

clone::

	If the source repository name starts with p4:// then this
	creates the destination repository and pulls all changes from
	the p4 depot into it.

The **perfarce.tags** configuration option determines whether perfarce
tries to import Perforce labels as Mercurial tags.

*TortoiseHg Integration*

When the perfarce extension is enabled, it adds a :guilabel:`start revision`
configurable option to the clone tool, and a :guilabel:`P4` toolbar
button to the sync tool.

The toolbar button performs the p4pending operation.  It detects pending
Perforce changelists that have been "push"ed to your Perforce client but
have not been submitted, or have not been pulled back.  This opens the
pending changelist dialog so that you can view these pending changelists
and either submit or revert them.  If Perforce fails the submit because
your files are out of date, you must revert the changelist, pull from
Perforce, merge, then push again.

*Installation*

Perfarce comes bundled with TortoiseHg Windows installers, so you
enable perfarce by simply adding it to your Mercurial.ini or a
repository's hgrc like this::

	[extensions]
	perfarce=

.. note::
	The perfarce extension has been known to not work together with
	hgsubversion, so if you plan to use both extensions they should be
	enabled locally on the repositories that require them.
 
hgsubversion (SVN)
==================

* `hgsubversion <http://bitbucket.org/durin42/hgsubversion/wiki/Home>`_ home page
* `hgsubversion Extension <http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/HgSubversion>`_ wiki page
* `Working with Subversion Repositories <http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/WorkingWithSubversion>`_

hgsubversion, as it's name implies, allows you to use Mercurial as a
client to a Subversion server.  It can also be used to do straight
conversions of Subversion repositories into Mercurial.

*Installation*

TortoiseHg Windows installers come with the python-svn bindings that
hgsubversion requires, so one only needs to clone the hgsubversion
repository to your local computer::

	hg clone http://bitbucket.org/durin42/hgsubversion/ C:\hgsvn

Then enable the extension in your Mercurial.ini file, specifying the
hgsubversion folder inside the cloned repository::

	[extensions]
	hgsubversion = C:\hgsvn\hgsubversion

You can verify that worked by typing :command:`hg help hgsubversion`

See the hgsubversion wiki for details of use.  We recommend an
hgsubversion version of at least 1.2.1 with Mercurial 1.8.

.. warning::
	When cloning a Subversion server, it is highly recommended
	to clone only the first few revisions then pull the rest.  The
	failure behavior of the clone command is to delete the incomplete
	clone, while pull is much more forgiving.

*TortoiseHg Integration*

Imported Subversion changesets will display the original Subversion checkin
number in the Changeset Info widget in the Revision Details task tab of the
Workbench.

hg-git (git)
============ 

* `hg-git <http://hg-git.github.com/>`_ home page
* `hg-git Extension <http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/HgGit>`_ wiki page
* `Mercurial for Git users <http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/GitConcepts>`_

hg-git, as its name implies, allows you to use Mercurial as a
client to a git server.  It can also be used to do straight conversions
of Git repositories into Mercurial.

*Installation*

TortoiseHg Windows installers come with the python-git bindings (named
dulwich) that hg-git requires, so one only needs to clone the
hg-git repository to your local computer::

	hg clone http://bitbucket.org/durin42/hg-git/ C:\hg-git

Then enable hggit in your Mercurial.ini file::

	[extensions]
	hggit = C:\hg-git\hggit

You can verify that worked by typing :command:`hg help hggit`

Current versions of TortoiseHg include dulwich version 0.7.0.  We
recommend to use hg-git version 0.2.6 with this version of dulwich
and Mercurial 1.8.

See the hggit documentation for details of use.

Beware the 'incoming' command appears broken when speaking with git
repositories, and 'outgoing' does not show much useful info. So you are
restricted to simple push and pull commands, which is common with
Mercurial extensions that speak to external revision control tools.
