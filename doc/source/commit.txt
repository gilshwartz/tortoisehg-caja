.. module:: commit.dialog
	:synopsis: Dialog used to perform commit

The commit tool is second most commonly used application after the
Workbench.  Not only can the commit tool commit your changes, but it can
also examine the state of your working directory and perform most
routine maintenance tasks (add new files, detect renames, manage the
ignore filter, etc).

Features
--------

Enumerating the toolbar buttons:

	:guilabel:`Branch dialog`
		Shows the current branch name of the working directory. Normally
		this is informational only, but pressing this button opens up a
		branch maintenance dialog.  Do not use this feature unless you
		understand Mercurial's
		`named branches <http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/NamedBranches>`_.
	:guilabel:`Recent Commit Messages`
		A drop-down list of the 10 most recent commit messages. The
		the drop-down list is filled the first time it is opened.
	:guilabel:`Commit`
		Commit selected diffs in checked files.
	:guilabel:`Undo`
		Undo (rollback) last immediate commit. Your commit message will be
		available in the message history, so you can easily repeat the
		commit if necessary.


The file list has four columns:

	1) A checkbox that indicates whether the file is selected for an
	   operation.  The toolbar buttons only operate on checked files.
	   "Partially" selected files have a special check state.  This
	   column header is checkable, it will toggle the file selection
	   states.
	2) The :guilabel:`st` column holds the status of the file, defined
	   by Mercurial's status command, one of 'MARD?IC'.  A status of 'S'
	   indicates a dirty subrepository that needs to be committed.
	3) The :guilabel:`ms` column holds the merge state of the file,
	   defined by Mercurial's resolve command, one of ' RU'.  See the
	   merge section below.
	4) The canonical path of the file relative to the repository root

.. note::
	If the commit tool was started with a file pattern or selection, a
	button will appear at the bottom of the file list that can clear the
	file pattern and give you an unfiltered view of the entire working
	directory.

The :guilabel:`Status` button has a menu with checkable options that
toggle the display of the various classes of files {modified, added,
removed, deleted, unknown, clean, ignored}.

*Removed* means a revisioned file has been marked as removed. *Deleted*
means a revisioned file is missing but Mercurial has not been told to
quit tracking that file. For instance, if you rename a revisioned file
in Explorer, the original filename will show up as deleted and the
new filename will show up as unknown. By right-clicking on the new
filename you can bring up the rename guessing dialog which can discover
the rename by comparing file contents and mark the old file as removed
and the new file as added while recording the whole operation as a
rename.

*Unknown* files are not tracked by Mercurial, but they also do not match
any ignore filters you have configured.  Unknown files are shown by
default because they are usually files that need to be added to revision
control.  It is recommended that you keep your ignore filters up to date
to ensure that is the case.  The context menu of unknown files has an
option open the ignore pattern tool.

*Clean* files are tracked files that have not been modified, while
*Ignored* files are untracked files that match a configured ignore
pattern.  Neither of those file types are shown by default, unless a the
user includes such a file in a selection (explorer) or provides the file
name on the command line.

Keyboard navigation
-------------------

:kbd:`Ctrl-Enter`
	Trigger the commit
:kbd:`Ctrl-E`
	Reflow the paragraph currently under the cursor.  You must configure
	a message format policy for this shortcut to work.

File Context Menus
------------------

When right clicking on files in the file list, you will get a context
menu of commands that are applicable to the selected files.

For unknown **?** files, the context menu will allow you to detect
renames (if you think the unknown file is a copy or rename of a
revisioned file) or to configure the repository's ignore filter (if the
unknown file should never be revisioned and you want Mercurial to ignore
it).


Merging
-------

The commit tool has a special mode when it is opened in a repository
that is in a merged state (either a merge is in progress, or an update
was performed that caused a conflict).

The merge state *ms* column is especially useful in this mode.  Files
that are marked with *R* are files where Mercurial and/or the user have
successfully merged (resolved) changes from both parents. Files that
are marked with *U* have unresolved changes. You can use the *Restart
Merge* context menu option to restart the merge for those files, or you
can use the *edit* context menu option to resolve the conflict by hand.
The *Restart Merge* menu option allows you to select the merge tool to
use to perform the merge, or even to pick one version or the other
unconditionally (internal:local, internal:other).  After the conflicts
have been manually resolved, you must use the *mark resolved* context
menu option to change the file's merge state to *R*.

Mercurial will not allow you to commit a merge if any files have
unresolved *U* merge states.

For your reference, *local* is the revision you had checked out when you
started the merge and *other* is the revision you merged with.

To undo a failed merge attempt, you must tell Mercurial to remove the
second parent from your working directory.  This usually means
performing a clean update of the first parent.  The merge tool has an
:guilabel:`Undo` button which does exactly that.

Once you have your working directory back at one parent revision, you
may restart the merge process.

Commit Message Pane
-------------------

The commit message pane has these special context menu options:

	:guilabel:`Paste Filenames`:
		Paste checked filenames into the commit message at the cursor.
	:guilabel:`Apply Format`:
		Apply configured message wrap policy to current message.
	:guilabel:`Configure Format`:
		Opens the settings dialog to the :guilabel:`Commit` tab.

If your project has guidelines for the format of commit messages, you
can configure them in the settings tool.  The commit tool will enforce
your policy at commit time, and you can ask the tool to apply the format
to the current message.  The :guilabel:`Commit` tab of the settings tool
has these two configurables for commit message policy:

	:guilabel:`Summary Line Length`:
		Maximum length of the commit message summary line.  If set,
		TortoiseHg will draw a line at the specified width.


Subrepositories
---------------

A `subrepository <http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/subrepos>`_
is a feature introduced in Mercurial 1.3.  It allows one Mercurial
repository to store references to external Mercurial (or potentially
other VCS) repositories, and to include the state of those external
repositories in the main repository's history.

TortoiseHg 1.0 introduced rudimentary support for subrepositories, and
only in the commit / status tool.  When Mercurial considers a subrepo
dirty, it will appear in the commit tool as a special entry in the file
list with a status of *S*.  If a subrepo is included in the file list of
a commit, the subrepo is committed along with the other changes,
updating the .hgsubstate file in the main repository root.


Configurables
-------------

:menuselection:`Commit --> Username`
	Sets username associated with your commits (see :doc:`quick`)
:menuselection:`Commit --> Summary Line Length`
	Configures a 'policy' limit for summary lines
:menuselection:`Commit --> Close After Commit`:
	When set to True, the commit tool will close after a
	successful commit.

And three other features for *advanced* users.

:menuselection:`Commit --> Push After Commit`:
	If configured, the commit tool will try to push to the configured
	URL or alias after each commit.
:menuselection:`Commit --> Auto Commit List`:
	Comma separated list of files that are automatically included in
	every commit.  Intended for use only as a repository setting.
:menuselection:`TortoiseHg --> Max Diff Size`
	Configures the diff size limit

From command line
-----------------

The commit tool can be started from command line::

	thg commit [OPTIONS] [FILE]...

	aliases: ci

	commit tool

	options:

	 -u --user  record user as committer
	 -d --date  record datecode as commit date

	use "thg -v help commit" to show global options

For a quick help on the format of date type::
	
	hg help dates

.. vim: noet ts=4
