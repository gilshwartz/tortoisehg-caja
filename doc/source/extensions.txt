	:synopsis: Describe extensions bundled with TortoiseHg binary packages

This chapter describes Mercurial extensions that are shipped with
TortoiseHg binary packages for Windows.  These external extensions are
included as a convenience to users, so they can be easily enabled as
soon as they are needed.

Hgfold
======

`hgfold <http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/CaseFoldExtension>`_ is a
Mercurial extension that helps Windows users deal with filename case
collisions on VFAT and NTFS.

It adds options to the following Mercurial commands. Type
:command:`hg help <command>` for more information::

	up    - allows you to update to a revision with filename collisions
	merge - allows you to merge with a changeset that would create filename collisions
    
The extension does not currently do anything to prevent filename
collisions. See discussion on the Mercurial Wiki

**Installation**

To test the use of this plugin, you can specify it on the Mercurial
command line like this::

	hg --config "extensions.fold=" status

You may want to add it to your Mercurial.ini or a repository's hgrc like this::

	[extensions]
	fold=
 
If you do this, you can omit the --config command-line option.

**Warnings**

Like all merge operations, fold.py has to change the parents of the
working directory. It is still in early testing, so use with caution.

If you get an error about an unknown changeset after running
:command:`hg recover` try
:command:`hg debugsetparents <number of tip revision>`.
You can find the number of the tip revision by running :command:`hg log -l 2`.

Perfarce
========

`Perfarce <http://www.kingswood-consulting.co.uk/hg/perfarce/>`_ home
page.

This extension is documented in :ref:`perfarce-perforce` section of
:doc:`nonhg` chapter.
 
HGEOL
=====

The hgeol extension is the eventual successor to the win32text
extension.  It tries to resolve the EOLN compatibility problems in a
more complete and robust fashion.  Instead of documenting it here, we
will link to it's online documents which are continually evolving.

Mercurial-Keyring
=================

* `Mercurial Keyring <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mercurial_keyring>`_ home page
* `Keyring Extension <http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/KeyringExtension>`_ wiki page

Keyring extension uses services of the keyring library to securely save
authentication passwords (HTTP/HTTPS and SMTP) using system specific
password database (Mate Keyring, KDE KWallet, OSXKeyChain, dedicated
solutions for Win32 and command line).

**What it does**

The extension prompts for the HTTP password on the first pull/push
to/from given remote repository (just like it is done by default), but
saves the password (keyed by the combination of username and remote
repository url) in the password database. On the next run it checks for
the username in :file:`.hg/hgrc`, then for suitable password in the password
database, and uses those credentials if found.

Similarly, while sending emails via SMTP server which requires
authorization, it prompts for the password on first use of given server,
then saves it in the password database and reuses on successive runs.

In case password turns out incorrect (either because it was invalid, or
because it was changed on the server) it just prompts the user again.

**Installation**

First, the extension must be enabled in your Mercurial.ini file as::

	[extensions]
	mercurial_keyring=

**Password backend configuration**

The most appropriate password backend should usually be picked automatically,
without configuration. Still, if necessary, it can be configured using
:file:`~/keyringrc.cfg` file (:file:`keyringrc.cfg` in the home directory of
the current user).
Refer to `keyring docs <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/keyring>`_
for more details.

.. note::
	On Windows XP and above, your encrypted passwords are stored in the
	credentials subsystem using
	`CredRead <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa374804%28VS.85%29.aspx>`_ and `CredWrite <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa375187%28VS.85%29.aspx>`_

.. note::
	On Windows 2K, the encrypted passwords are stored in the system
	registry under HKCU\\Software\\Mercurial\\Keyring.

**Repository configuration (HTTP)**

Edit repository-local :file:`.hg/hgrc` and save there the remote repository
path and the username, but do not save the password. For example::

	[paths]
	myremote = https://my.server.com/hgrepo/someproject

	[auth]
	myremote.schemes = http https
	myremote.prefix = my.server.com/hgrepo
	myremote.username = mekk

Simpler form with url-embedded name can also be used::

	[paths]
	bitbucket = https://User@bitbucket.org/User/project_name/

.. note::
	If both username and password are given in :file:`.hg/hgrc`, extension
	will use them without using the password database. If username is not
	given, extension will prompt for credentials every time, also
	without saving the password. So, in both cases, it is effectively
	reverting to the default behaviour.

Consult `[auth] <http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/hgrc.5.html#auth>`_
section documentation for more details.

**Repository configuration (SMTP)**

Edit either repository-local :file:`.hg/hgrc`, or :file:`~/.hgrc` (the latter
is usually preferable) and set there all standard email and smtp properties,
including smtp username, but without smtp password. For example::

	[email]
	method = smtp
	from = Joe Doe <Joe.Doe@remote.com>

	[smtp]
	host = smtp.gmail.com
	port = 587
	username = JoeDoe@gmail.com
	tls = true

Just as in case of HTTP, you must set username, but must not set password here
to use the extension, in other cases it will revert to the default behaviour.

**Usage**

Configure the repository as above, then just pull and push (or email) You
should be asked for the password only once (per every username +
remote_repository_url combination). 

.. vim: noet ts=4

pbranch
=======

Patch Branches (`pbranch <http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/PatchBranchExtension>`_) 
is a way to develop a series of patches for submission into a main 
repo. It is based on topic branches, one per patch, and is thus highly 
suitable for collaborative and/or long-term patch development and 
maintenance.

`A detailed manual <http://arrenbrecht.ch/mercurial/pbranch/>`_ can be found online.

It adds a number of commands which can be listed with 
:command:`hg help pbranch`::

 pbackout       - backs out the current patch branch (undoes all its changes)
 pdiff          - prints the final diff for the current or given patch branch
 peditmessage   - edit the patch message
 pemail         - send patches by email
 pexport        - exports patches
 pextdiff       - combines pdiff and extdiff
 pgraph         - print an ASCII art rendering of the patch dependency graph
 pmerge         - merge pending heads from dependencies into patch branches
 pmessage       - print the patch message(s)
 pnew           - start a new patch branch
 pstatus        - print status of current (or given) patch branch
 reapply        - reverts the working copy of all files touched by REV to REV

TortoiseHg will provide a new task tab that shows the patch dependency graph.

**Installation**

As this extension is not installed with TortoiseHg, you have to download 
it from `<http://bitbucket.org/parren/hg-pbranch>`_. Be sure to dowload the
right one according to the Mercurial version included with TortoiseHg (see the
wiki page on the download site).
To test the use of this plugin, you can specify it on the Mercurial
command line like this::

	hg --config "extensions.pbranch=C:\path\to\pbranch.py" pstatus

You may want to add it to your Mercurial.ini or a repository's hgrc like this::

	[extensions]
	pbranch = C:\path\to\pbranch.py
 
If you do this, you can omit the --config command-line option.
