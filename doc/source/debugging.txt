Debugging 
=========

.. module:: debugging
	:synopsis: Debug problems in shell extension or dialogs

Dialogs
-------

Stderr is being captured to a buffer that is being inspected at program
exit.  If any serious errors (tracebacks, etc) are found in the stderr
buffer the entire contents are sent to the bug report tool so the user
can (should) report a bug.  If you suspect there are errors that are not
being reported, you can set the environment variable **THGDEBUG** to any
value to disable the stderr buffering.

If you have a bit of Python knowledge, you can also use::

    thg --debugger <command>

To disable the forking behavior of thg, you can either set an
environment variable **THG_HGTK_SPAWN**, or add the command line
parameter '--nofork'.


Windows
~~~~~~~

To debug the changelog viewer, for instance, enter these commands
into a :command:`cmd.exe` window, while inside the repository::

    set THGDEBUG=1
    thg --nofork log

Linux/MacOSX
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To debug the changelog viewer, for instance, enter these commands
into your shell window, while inside the repository::
    
    export THGDEBUG=1
    thg --nofork log



Shell Extension
---------------

The debugging mechanisms depend on your platform.

Windows
~~~~~~~

See also http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc144064(VS.85).aspx
for some info bits about Running and Testing Shell Extensions on Windows

The :command:`DbgView` tool from the SysInternals suite will capture
debug messages from the shell extension.  However, the shell
extension does not emit debugging info by default.  It must be enabled
by setting the registry key defined in
:file:`win32/shellext/DebugShellExt.reg` in the TortoiseHg source
repository.  You can double-click on this file to load the key into your
registry.

Another option is to exit the :command:`TortoiseHgOverlayServer` system tray
application and start it from the command line.  It will emit some debug
information to the console.

Caja
~~~~~~~~

Debugging is done via the environment variable DEBUG_THG

* to test in a separate process::

    DEBUG_THG=Ne TMPDIR=/tmp/anydir/ --no-desktop caja [path]

* to test in the main instance:: 

    caja -q
    DEBUG_THG=NOe caja

* permanent debugging, set DEBUG_THG in a file which is read on session
  start (~/.profile, ~/.xprofile)

Upper case characters in DEBUG_THG specify modules.  Only *O* and *N*
for *OverlayCache* and *Caja*, respectively, are supported module
names.  Lower case characters imply parts. Only *e* is supported,
implying *error* messages.

To restart caja, chose either

1) killall caja (the session restarts caja automatically, stdin and stdout go to ~/.xsession-errors)

2) caja -q; caja (stdin and stdout are on the console)
