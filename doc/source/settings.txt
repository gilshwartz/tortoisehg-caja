	Settings dialog

The Settings dialog is used to configure both TortoiseHg and the
underlying Mercurial DVCS.  Since TortoiseHg uses Mercurial's underlying
configuration system to store and retrieve its settings, these are
essentially the same thing.

Mercurial on Windows has a three-tier configuration system.

1) A site-wide configuration file in
   :file:`C:\\Program Files\\TortoiseHg\\Mercurial.ini`
   This file is read first and thus has the lowest priority.
2) A per-user configuration file in
   :file:`C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\Mercurial.ini`
   This file is read second and thus can override settings in the
   site-wide configuration file.
3) A per-repository configuration file in :file:`repo-root\\.hg\\hgrc` This
   file is read last and can override site-wide and user global settings.

The site-wide file can be overwritten on upgrades so it is recommended
that you do not make changes to this file.  Instead, you should make
changes to your user :file:`Mercurial.ini` and/or the repository
:file:`hgrc` file.  The TortoiseHg Settings dialog enforces this
suggestion by only operating in two modes:

Global
	edits your user :file:`Mercurial.ini` file
Repository
	edits a repository :file:`.hg/hgrc` file

You may toggle between the two modes using the combo box at the top of
the dialog, or directly edit the file in your configured visual editor.

Most TortoiseHg users will want to store all configurables in their
global user settings, and only use the repository hgrc to store paths
(remote repository aliases) and web settings, though it is possible to
override many configurables per-repository (a common example is to
configure a username for use in a specific repository).  Also note that
the user and repository configuration files may not exist until you run
the Settings dialog for the first time.

Tabs
====

The Settings tool is a tabbed application.

Each tab corresponds roughly to a section of your :file:`Mercurial.ini`
file, though there is a certain amount of overlap. Some sections were
split across multiple tabs for clarity.

Every tab but :guilabel:`Sync` has the same format, a list of
configurable options with a drop-down combo box with possible values and
a history of options you have used for that setting. The configurable
name (label) has a tooltip which describes in more detail what you are
configuring and its default value.  The description of the currently
focused configurable is also shown in a text box at the bottom of the
dialog.

Please consult the Mercurial wiki for more detailed information about
these configurables (except for the first three tabs:
:guilabel:`TortoiseHg`, :guilabel:`Commit`, :guilabel:`Changelog`, which
are specific to TortoiseHg).

.. module:: TortoiseHg.settings
	:synopsis: Dialog used to set general TortoiseHg preferences

TortoiseHg
----------

:guilabel:`3-way Merge Tool:`
	Graphical merge program for resolving merge conflicts.  If left
	unspecified, Mercurial will use the first applicable tool it finds
	on your system or use its internal merge tool that leaves conflict
	markers in place.  Chose :guilabel:`internal:merge` to force
	conflict markers, :guilabel:`internal:prompt` to always select local
	or other, or :guilabel:`internal:dump` to leave files in the working
	directory for manual merging.

:guilabel:`Visual Diff Tool:`
	Specify visual diff tool as described in the [merge-tools] section
	of your Mercurial configuration files.  If left unspecified,
	TortoiseHg will use the selected merge tool. Failing that it uses
	the first applicable tool it finds.

:guilabel:`Skip Diff Window:`
	Bypass the builtin visual diff dialog and directly use your
	visual diff tool's directory diff feature.  Only enable this
	feature if you know your diff tool has a valid extdiff
	configuration.  Default: False.

:guilabel:`Visual Editor:`
	Specify the visual editor used to view files, etc.

:guilabel:`CLI Editor:`
	The editor to use during a commit and other
	instances where Mercurial needs multiline input from
	the user.  Only used by command line interface commands.

:guilabel:`Tab Width:`
	Specify the number of spaces that tabs expand to in various
	TortoiseHg windows. Default: Not expanded.

:guilabel:`Max Diff Size:`
	The maximum size file (in KB) that TortoiseHg will
	show changes for in the changelog, status, and commit windows.
	A value of zero implies no limit.  Default: 1024 (1MB).

:guilabel:`Bottom Diffs:`
	Show the diff panel below the file list in status, shelve, and
	commit dialogs.  Default: False (show diffs to right of file list).

:guilabel:`Capture stderr:`
	Redirect stderr to a buffer which is parsed at the end of the process
	for runtime errors. Default: True.

:guilabel:`Fork GUI:`
	When running thg from the command line, fork a background process
	to run graphical dialogs. Default: True.

:guilabel:`Full Path Title:`
	Show a full directory path of the repository in the dialog title
	instead of just the root directory name.  Default: False

:guilabel:`Spell Check Language:`
	Default language for spell check.  System language is used if not
	specified.  Examples: en, en_GB, en_US.  Spell checking requires
	gtkspell, which is only available on Mate PCs.

	Word wrap length of the commit message.  If
	set, the popup menu can be used to format

:guilabel:`Push After Commit:`
	Attempt to push to default push target after every successful
	commit.  Default: False
